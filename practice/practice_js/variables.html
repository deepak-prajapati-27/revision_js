      //In js there are three type of variables
      //1. var
      //2. let
      //3. const

      //note: var is not not used after the js version es6, before vs6 var was used the most. now let and const are used

      //In js there are rules for declaration a variables

      // we can use _, $, alphabets

      //   let a_$ = "deepak";
      //   console.log(a_$);

      // we cannot declare varibales by numbers or other symbols

      //   let 32b?* = 32; Invalid or unexpected token error arrived
      //   console.log(b);

      //there are three type of getting output

      // console.log(put here the variable); this is the most used because the other 2 dont show the error.
      //alert(put here the variable)
      //   document.write(put here the variable)

      // 1. var

      // var a; this is called declaring a variable
      // var a="deepak"; this is assigning a value to a variable
      var a = "rahul"; //this is declaring a variable and assigning a value to a variable
      var a = "rahul parmar"; //here we can re-declare
      a = "rahul bhai"; // here we can re-assign
      //   console.log(a);

      // 2. let

      let b = "punit";
      //   let b = "punit patel"; //we cannot re-declare   this will arrive :Identifier 'b' has already been declared
      b = "punit mba"; // we can re-assign
      //   console.log(b);

      //3. const

      const c = "tarun";
      //   const c = "tarun parmar"; // we cannot re-declare this will arrive :Identifier 'c' has already been declared
      //   c = "tarun wd"; //    we cannot re-assign //   Assignment to constant variable.
      //   console.log(c);
